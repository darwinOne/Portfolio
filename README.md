* **Machine Learning**
  * [Speech Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/darwinOne/Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SER-)<br/>
  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been under the scrutiny of researchers for many years. The emotion recognition system through speech is the 
  ability to identify the type of emotion from a human speech to create a natural interaction between humans and machines (computers). This project uses the Linear
  Predictive Coding (LPC) feature extraction method with orders of 3, 8, and 16. Then the classification method used is the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method.
  * [Acnetect (Collaboration Project)](https://github.com/iamfinnz/Acnetect)<br/>
  This project is a collaborative project with the aim of creating a mobile application named Acnetect. The function of this application is to detect the type of acne
  through camera capture, then this application will provide results of the type of acne as well as provide recommendations for the right treatment of each acne.
  In this project I am responsible for creating a Machine Learning model for this application.<br/>
  * Next Project (Soon...)<br/>
  
* **Coursework**<br/>
Here are some Machine Learning projects I worked on while I was in college.
  * [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/darwinOne/Natural-Language-Processing-Tensorflow-)
  This is an NLP project that I worked on while in college. There are some simple projects related to NLP like Predict Next Word, and Explore BBC News Archive, etc.
  * [Text Summarization](https://github.com/darwinOne/Text-Processing-NLP)
  This project is still related to NLP, to be precise, making text summarization web apps. This project was developed using the NLP Libraries namely spaCy and Flask.
  * [Sequence, Time Series, and Prediction](https://github.com/darwinOne/Sequence-Time-Series-and-Prediction-Beginner)
  A simple time series project that functions to predict the next value using a Deep Neural Network.
  * [Face Recognition using Haar Cascade (OpenCV)](https://github.com/darwinOne/Face-Recognition-using-Haar-Cascade)
  Image Processing project with the aim of identifying faces using the Haar Cascade algorithm.
